# Production Problem 07: Implementing HCI guidelines for touchscreens

## The Problem

Using the HCI guidelines from either Apple/iOS, GNOME, or Windows, redesign the login page at
http://my.iit.edu/ for a touch-friendly environment. Use this to kickstart your work on Project 2.

**You only need to sketch your redesign**, and in the text below, reference at least three different
points of guidance from chosen HCI guidelines that went into your redesign sketches (you might
want to do multiple sketches, each highlighting a different feature of the same overall design).

## Resources

* Apple iOS HCI Guidlines:
  https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/overview/design-principles/
* Gnome Desktop:
  https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/design
* Windows Desktop Guidelines:
  https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/design

## Deliverables

Small commits to your Production Problems repository that include:

1) photographs of sketches of your new design, from your sketchbook
2) an explanation of three different points of guidance from your chosen guidelines (point to the
   specific URL where the guidance can be found) that you implemented in your sketch, written below:

* HCI Guidline One (URL):https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/ui-controls/text-fields/
* How you implemented it in your sketch:
    This link showed the importance of placeholders into the text-fields. 
    It also states that we need to have a secure text-fields. 
    I think placeholders is a good way to guide the user into what to fill. 

* HCI Guidline Two (URL):
* How you implemented it in your sketch:https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/visual-design/animation/
  This link showed me the need to visuals in the website. It also helped me because it said to keep things constant and 
  not to overpopulate my website with more animations just because. 

* HCI Guidline Three (URL):
* How you implemented it in your sketch:https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/visual-design/color/

  Color is a very important when building a website. This really brings people to view and stay at a website.
  In this link helped me want to add more color into my design. I usually like the usual black and white websites but
  it is fun to add some color and typology into building sites.
