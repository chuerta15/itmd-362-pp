# Production Problem 08: Emotional Design Hunt

## The Problem

First, read the assigned reading from Donald Norman, listed on the ITMD 362 syllabus.

Then, locate a physical object that you use regularly in your life (does not have to be an electronic or digital object), take a photograph of it, and identify in a sentence or two its visceral, behavioral, and reflective levels of emotional design. Then, develop a list of three qualities in that objectâ€™s emotional design that your group might use in your MyIIT redesign project. Be sure to share these with your group.

## Deliverables

A. Photograph of the object (place in the pp-09/ directory and commit).

B. Emotional design levels of your object:

* Visceral: 
  I had spent some time looking for an agenda that had everything that stood out to me.
  Each one of the agendas that I had seen were too plain. 
  They were just plain black and they did not have anything girly. 
  When I first seen this item, I really liked that it had flowers. Once I opened it that is when 
  I knew I had to buy it. This agenda has enough space for notes as well as it divides the 
  months by color and tabs. 

* Behavioral:
  This agenda does what it needs to do. It has stickers that allows me to personalize it.
  It helps me keep track of the assignments that I need to do which is the main reason
  why I brought it. It also helps me schedule for my payments and things that I need to pay.
  

* Reflective:
  My overall impression of the product is positive. I would buy this product again once
  I am done with it. When I have to show someone assignments that need to be completed I 
  show them my agenda. I am not afraid to hide it. 

C.  Emotional design qualities of the object that might be useful for Project 2 MyIIT redesign:

1. 
2.
3.
