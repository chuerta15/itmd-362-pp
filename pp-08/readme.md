# Production Problem 08: Emotional Design Hunt

## The Problem

First, read the assigned reading from Donald Norman, listed on the ITMD 362 syllabus.

Then, locate a physical object that you use regularly in your life (does not have to be an electronic or digital object), take a photograph of it, and identify in a sentence or two its visceral, behavioral, and reflective levels of emotional design. Then, develop a list of three qualities in that objectâ€™s emotional design that your group might use in your MyIIT redesign project. Be sure to share these with your group.

## Deliverables

A. Photograph of the object (place in the pp-09/ directory and commit).

B. Emotional design levels of your object:

* Visceral: 
  When I brought this item I wanted a new agenda. Each one of the agendas that I had seen were 
  too plain. They were just plain black and hardly have anything girly. 
  When I first seen this item, I really liked that it had flowers. Once I opened it that is when 
  I knew I had to buy it. This agenda has enough space for notes as well as it separates the 
  months by color and tabs. 

* Behavioral:

* Reflective:

C.  Emotional design qualities of the object that might be useful for Project 2 MyIIT redesign:

1.
2.
3.
