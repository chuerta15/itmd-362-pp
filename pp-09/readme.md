# Production Problem 09: Usability Checklists

## The Problem

Usability checklists are typical, and sometimes mindless, tools/magic tricks used to find usability problems in web and other digital projects. What you are going to do for this Production Problem is to locate at least 2 different usability checklists of at least 25 items (use Google, but challenge yourself to go beyond the first page of results). From those lists, create your own, condensed list of exactly ten items. Share with your group for Project 3 to help yourselves create your own master usability checklist.

## Deliverables

* URLs for the usability checklists you've found:

* Your own condensed, ten-item must-have usability checklist:

1. Navigation on the webpage should be easy to find and use.
2. The main content should be easily identified.
3. The website generates feedback once the task was completed.
4. Instructions on the webpage are easy to follow
5. Forms are kept short if possible and provide only the information needed.
6. The content of the webpage should be sized to viewport.
7. Font should be easy to read.
8. Once logged in the website provides a welcome.
9. Consistency should be throughout the website.
10. Use simple language in which everyone will be able to understand.
